CHANGES
-----------------
#####0.9.1.130607
- Created variable '_GSPRINT_' in config.php to hold the path for gsprint.
- The report was based on dates,so it showed the total of a day included what you charged last night after 00:00. Now, the report is based on the daily cash.

#####0.9.1.130606
- In backend, now you can go to the product page directly by clicking on it in the sales report.
- Fixed when the system is configured without decimals and in some cases a decimal .5 appeared after the total when charging separated accounts together.
